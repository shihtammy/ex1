<h2>WORKHARD ANYWHERE | March 11, 2015</h2><br/>

<p>I discovered this slogan/website a while ago when one of my favorite bloggers, imaginary zebra, posted this on his instagram and I really like it because their concept is so simple yet quite motivating. In my opinion, at least. WORKHARD ANYWHERE collaborates with many pioneers and they basically take a picture of the place they are studying at with the WORKHARD ANYWHERE wallpaper on their computer screen. And for me, when I see it, it just motivates me to "workhard...anywhere..."</p>

<h2>Imaginary Zebra | March 9, 2015</h2><br/>

<p>Hands down one of my favorite bloggers to date! Actually, he's one of the first bloggers I started following consistently. The person who started Imaginary Zebra, Benson Chou, graduated from UC Davis and was always interested in the creative works, which is how he began his personal branding through Imaginary Zebra. He's a blogger, photographer, and a designer. Someone that I look to for inspiration. And he's even collaborated with some big names out there~ </p>
