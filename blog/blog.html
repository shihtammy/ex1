<p>I discovered this slogan/website a while ago when one of my favorite bloggers, imaginary zebra, posted this on his instagram and I really like it because their concept is so simple yet quite motivating. In my opinion, at least. WORKHARD ANYWHERE collaborates with many pioneers and they basically take a picture of the place they are studying at with the WORKHARD ANYWHERE wallpaper on their computer screen. And for me, when I see it, it just motivates me to "workhard...anywhere..."</p>

<p>Soundcloud is a site that I use quite often to listen to music. In fact, I actually use on a daily to listen to music. This site not only has great music but the interface design of this site is great as well. The biggest thing about this website that I appreciate the most is the fact that I can get to music right away. As soon as you go to the site, the home page is a list of suggestions of music, whether you have an account or not. The interface design of this site is really simple yet intuitive. The first homepage lets you discover new music based off of who you follow. And a small detail about this site that I really love and appreciate is the part where each song plays and instead of it being just a bar, it's a representation of the music's beat and flow (not sure if I made sense here). Overall, this website has an overall theme and design and it all ties in together extremely well.</p>
